--This dataset contains a snapshot of data pulled from Petfinder.com detailing information on dogs that were up for adoption on a single day.  
--This includes information on their breed, size, age, color, current state, origin state, and more.  We will focus on movement between states,
--as well as segmentation of the adoptable population.

--What breeds are most likely to be listed for adoption

SELECT breed_primary, count(*) as frequency
FROM `adoptable-dogs.adoptable_dog_data.dog_descriptions`
GROUP BY breed_primary
ORDER BY frequency DESC

--What role does age play

SELECT age, count(*) as frequency
FROM `adoptable-dogs.adoptable_dog_data.dog_descriptions`
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY frequency DESC

--What role does size play

SELECT size, count(*) as frequency

--What percentage of the sample falls into the highest two risk factors (Medium Sized, Adult Dogs)
